# Marischedule - A Mock Schedule Creator
Marischedule allows Marianopolis students to easily create mock schedules based on currently available classes.

## How It Works
Students are given a PDF with the list of classes as well as corresponding teachers and times. 


* The PDF is scraped to create a JSON formatted list of all the classes
* Ratings are scraped from ratemyteachers.com.
* http://easyautocomplete.com/ is used to add attractive search functionality
* jQuery is used for the frontend functionality
* Foundation is used as a framework
